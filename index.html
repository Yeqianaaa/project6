                <h2>by Yeqian Li</h6>
                <p>This project is called Time Traveler and is an concept art. It tells the story of a little boy traveling in time and is presented in the form of digital illustration. I plan to use brown tones throughout the entire project. It will make my work look more unified, and can convey a sense of antiquity, mystery, and grandeur, which is very in line with the atmosphere I want to showcase. The entire project was mainly created through Procreat, and with the help of Photoshop. I hope it can provide atmosphere and ideas for games or movies related to certain themes.

                <h3>Character Design</h3>
                <p>The main character is a little boy, Alex.
This is the story of a little boy traveling through time. He is a time messenger with his own mission. He shuttles through various corners of the world, only to complete the cycle of time one after another. He crosses the river, hide in the work room behind the clock to avoid being caught by the guards, and sleeps on the clock when he got tired.
Alex is always being in a scene full of time elements, including clocks, gears, hourglass, maps, etc., aims to reflect the vastness of time and the insignificance of humanity by telling the interesting interaction between the boy and time.
I think he should wear lighter clothes and look plain bacause he is always on the way. I hope he has a childlike expression on his face. And the thin body can show the movements of the characters more clearly. And due that he doesn't have a fixed place to live, he is always on the way, his body should also be thinner.
